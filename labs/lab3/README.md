# Insturctions for completeing Lab 3 
## Basic page markup

**Objective:**
The tags and structure used here are basic, so, try to complete as much as possible from memory. Use the image file showing how the formatting should look by turning the raw text file into an HTML file.

**Process:**
1. Using your text editor (i.e., Notepad++), create a new plain text file. If your editor asks for encoding type then select “utf-8”. 
1. Use Notepad++ to save your new file. 
    * Select *Save as* from *File* in the top navigation
    * File Name=*index*
    * Save As Type=*Hyper Text Markup Language File*
1. Start by adding the proper HTML5 Skeleton Structure to the document.
1. The page title should be *Excerpts From Select Public Domain Books*.
1. Add content to your index.html page using the text found in *lab3source.txt* file. 
1. Use *lab3_image.png* as a guide to mark up your content with HTML elements. This time there are no red text hints.  
    *	**Hint:** *notice the table at the top of the page and the bulleted list at the bottom of the page.*
1. Your page, when viewed in your browser, should look similar to the *lab3_image.png* file. HTML text looks slightly different on different browsers, so, text breaks might not be exactly the same.
1. Follow the video instructions for testing and turning in labs (*How to Turn In Labs*). 
1. Turn in the following:
    * Repo Link
    * Live Link
    * Image of Validation Screen Capture
    * Image of File Comparison
