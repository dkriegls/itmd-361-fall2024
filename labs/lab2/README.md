## Understanding the HTML5 Skeleton Structure

**Objective:**
All your pages and sites should start from the basic HTML5 Skeleton Structure. In this lab, you will build an html page using this structure and add some content using HTML tags. 

**Process:**
1. Using your text editor (i.e., Notepad++), create a new plain text file. If your editor asks for encoding type then select “utf-8”. 
1. Use Notepad++ to save your new file. 
    * Select *Save as* from *File* in the top navigation
    * File Name = *index*
    * Save As Type = *Hyper Text Markup Language File*
1. Start by adding the proper HTML5 Skeleton Structure to the document.
1. The page title should be *Internet Technologies and Web Design*. Use this in both the head section title tag and for the level 1 heading ```<h1>``` tag in the page content.
1. Add content to your *index.html* page using the text found in *lab2raw_txt.html*. 
1. Use *lab2_image.png* as a guide to mark up your content with HTML elements. I hope it’s obvious that the red text is to guide you and should not be included in the final page. 
1. Your page, when viewed in your browser, should look similar to the *lab2_image.png* file. HTML text looks slightly different on different browsers, so, text breaks might not be exactly the same.
1. Follow the video instructions for testing and turning in labs (*How to Turn In Labs*). 
1. Turn in the following:
    * Repo Link
    * Live Link
    * Image of Validation Screen Capture
    * Image of File Comparison
